# Automatic Spider

Source code for automatic descending spider halloween decoration.

The RPi will drive one or more stepper motors, which will in turn be
attached to a spool of fishing line attached to the house eaves.  A spider,
hanging from the line, will be raised and lowered by the motor.

And advanced version will communicate via radio with an arduino on the
spider.  The arduino can be commanded to blink LED eyes or flex legs via
servo.
